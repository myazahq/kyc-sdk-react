/**
 * The centred screen the hosted entry shows AROUND the flow — loading, link
 * unavailable, already submitted — full-page on the hosted page, a compact
 * block when embedded in a host panel.
 *
 * Themed from the workflow's APPEARANCE when the caller has it. The hosted
 * pages read it on the server (`/session/by-token/:token/appearance`, or the
 * link's twin) before the bootstrap, so these screens paint in the org's
 * colours from the first frame. Until 2026-09-05 they wore the SDK default,
 * Myaza purple on white, until the bootstrap answered, then repainted: a brand
 * flash on every hosted open, and the org's applicants saw Myaza's brand
 * before their own.
 *
 * A dark workflow is dark on the first frame too: the dark palette rides as
 * inline vars (`buildThemeVars` merges the `dark` block) and the `dark` class
 * wraps the screen, neither of which needs an effect, so a server render is
 * already right. The configured theme is then applied to the real theme root
 * on mount, which is what resolves 'system' and what the flow's modal does
 * next. Nothing here reads the appearance's logo: the org's name and mark
 * belong to the flow's header, once there is a flow.

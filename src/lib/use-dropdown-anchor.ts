/**
 * Position a dropdown so it escapes the step body's scroll container.
 *
 * The SDK's step body is `overflow-y-auto`, and an absolutely-positioned menu
 * inside a scroll container is CLIPPED by it — which is why the dial-code list
 * appeared to vanish behind the footer. `z-index` cannot fix that: it is
 * overflow clipping, not stacking.
 *
 * The menu therefore renders into `document.body`, fixed to viewport
 * coordinates, so it can float over the dialog rather than being bounded by it.
 *
 * Rendering there costs three things the dialog would otherwise have given it,
 * and each is paid back explicitly:
 *
 *   • Pointer events. Radix Dialog sets `pointer-events: none` on the body
 *     while open, so the menu re-enables them on itself (see `style` below).
 *   • Theme variables. Those live on `.kyc-root`, which is no longer an
 *     ancestor, so they are merged into the menu's own style.
 *   • Scrolling. The dialog's scroll lock preventDefaults wheel and touchmove
 *     everywhere outside its content, which left the list movable only by
 *     dragging its scrollbar thumb. Callers wrap the menu in
 *     `<DropdownSurface>`, a nested lock that takes over while it is open.
 *
 * `position: fixed` is correct here only BECAUSE the host is the body: the
 * dialog carries `xl:translate-x-[-50%]` on desktop, and a transformed ancestor
 * would become the containing block for fixed descendants.
 *
 * It prefers to open downwards and shrinks its height budget to the room
 * available, so a long list scrolls rather than overflowing. When the trigger
 * sits near the bottom — a date field at the end of a long questionnaire — that
 * budget collapses to a sliver, so it FLIPS above instead. Flipping needs the
 * rendered height (to know where the top edge goes), which is why the caller
 * hands over the menu's ref and the position is refined once it has mounted.

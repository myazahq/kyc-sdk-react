/**
 * SdkFrame — the style-isolation boundary for embedded SDK mounts.
 *
 * The SDK ships a full Tailwind build, and mounting that globally in a host
 * app collides in both directions: the host's `.hidden`, element resets and
 * `!important` rules restyle the SDK, and the SDK's preflight, utilities and
 * document-global keyframes break the host (the dashboard hit all three
 * before it was banished to the hosted page). Shadow DOM makes both
 * directions structurally impossible: host selectors cannot match inside a
 * shadow tree, and the SDK's sheet lives only inside its roots.
 *
 * TWO shadow hosts, not one:
 *
 * - An INLINE host at the mount point, for in-flow content (the trigger
 *   button). `display: contents` keeps it out of the host app's layout.
 * - A PORTAL host appended to document.body, whose in-shadow frame is the
 *   portal target for every floating surface (Dialog, Select, dropdown menus,
 *   the liveness flash overlay). It sits at body level for the same reason
 *   those surfaces used to portal to document.body directly: `fixed`
 *   positioning resolves against the viewport only when no ancestor is
 *   transformed, and the mount point's host-app ancestors are not ours to
 *   vet. The frame is also the SDK's theme root — `.dark` lives on it, since
 *   a class on the host page's <html> cannot match across the boundary.
 *
 * Both roots adopt one shared CSSStyleSheet (sdk-styles.ts). The children are
 * React-portaled into the inline frame, so React context (config, theme,
 * portal host) flows into the shadow tree unchanged.

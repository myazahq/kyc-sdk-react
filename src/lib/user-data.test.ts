/**
 * `userData` is what makes the submitted name comparable against the name read off
 * the document. Two things must hold for that comparison to ever happen, and both
 * were doubted during a live debugging session:
 *
 *   1. a `workflowId` mount must not lose the prop, and
 *   2. an empty string must not count as a submitted name.
 *
 * The confusion was real: a PVC and a passport both came back with `dataMatch: null`,
 * and the example app looked like it was passing names because it always spread a
 * `userData` object — one built from blank inputs.

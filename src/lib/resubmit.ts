// Narrowing a flow to the steps a reviewer asked the applicant to redo.
//
// A reviewer looked at a finished verification and sent it back — usually
// because one thing was unreadable, not because everything was wrong. Making
// somebody retake a passport photo is reasonable; making them redo consent, the
// ID picker, liveness and a questionnaire to fix that photo is how you lose them.
//
// The instruction rides the session's config snapshot (`config.resubmit`), which
// is how every other per-session flow instruction travels. An SDK that predates
// this simply does not read the key and runs the whole flow, which is the safe
// degradation: asking for too much is recoverable, silently skipping a step the
// reviewer wanted is not.

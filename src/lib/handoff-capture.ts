// It is not a cosmetic question. Showing the gate MINTS a child session and
// transfers the budget to it, and the desktop cannot write again until that
// child is cancelled. Offering the handoff on a flow with nothing to hand off
// therefore does not merely waste a screen: it can strand the person on the
// device they are actually using.

// The old predicate was `enableLiveness !== false || documentCaptureNeedsCamera`,
// which is right for a full identity flow and wrong for every SCOPED one:
// `enableLiveness` is simply absent on a scoped config, so `!== false` is true
// and the gate fired on flows with no camera step whatsoever. A
// proof-of-address-only address flow is the clearest case (pick a file, done),
// and questionnaire and contact scopes are entirely typed.

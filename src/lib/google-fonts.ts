 * beats a free-text box nobody can spell "Plus Jakarta Sans" into. The load-
 * bearing one is SECURITY: the loader builds a fonts.googleapis.com URL from
 * this value, and this value can arrive from a server-stored, dashboard-authored
 * workflow. Interpolating an arbitrary string into a URL we then inject as a
 * stylesheet is an injection vector; interpolating a member of a fixed list is
 * not. **Never load a family that isn't in this array.**
 *
 * Keep in sync with the dashboard's copy in
 * `components/workflows/google-fonts.ts` — two repos, no shared package (same
 * arrangement as the fields catalog).

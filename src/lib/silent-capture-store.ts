// ─── Silent capture: the per-session record ─────────────────────────────────
//
// Frames taken this session, kept OUTSIDE the reducer on purpose, like the
// capture-integrity signals and the step log: a retake, a step revisit or a
// RETRY keeps frames already taken (they are evidence of who was there), and
// the cap has to be decided synchronously at the moment a frame is grabbed.
// Reset where a new session starts (the modal-open handlers in MyazaKYC).
//
// Uploads run in the background and fail silently; only frames whose upload
// succeeded are submitted (see buildSilentCaptureSubmission).

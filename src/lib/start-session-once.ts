// Collapses concurrent session starts into ONE request per launch.
//
// The per-instance ref guard in MyazaKYC is not enough: React StrictMode
// remounts the component with fresh refs, so each launch fired /session/start
// twice ~600ms apart. Without an externalUserId the server has nothing to
// resume by, so the second call minted a SECOND session — the flow adopted one
// and the orphan sat on the org's sessions list forever as "Not started".
//
// The window is short on purpose: this exists to collapse a double-invoke, not
// to cache sessions. A failure clears immediately so a retry is a real retry.

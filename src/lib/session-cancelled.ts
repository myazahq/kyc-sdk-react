// ─── A cancelled session ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An organisation (or Myaza support) can cancel a verification session midway,
// reversibly. While it is cancelled the server refuses to let the applicant
// reopen or restart it: `409 { error: 'session_cancelled', message }` from the
// session start, the hosted bootstrap and link mint, every request made with
// the hosted `hs_` bearer, progress saves and `/verify`; and the status read
// answers `status: 'cancelled'`.
//
// None of that is something the applicant can fix by trying again, so it must
// never reach the generic "Something went wrong / Try again" screen. These
// helpers are the one place that recognises it. Duck-typed on `code` rather
// than `instanceof KYCApiError`, so this module stays import-free (the API
// client depends on it, not the other way round).

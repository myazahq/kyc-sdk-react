// The defect this pins: KYCConfigProvider is mounted with an EXPLICIT prop
// list, so a workflow key that reaches the merged props but is missing from
// that list silently never exists for any step. It is a quiet failure — types
// pass, tests on the pure helpers pass, and the feature simply does not run.
// It shipped three times before this test: `requiredIdTypes` (multi-ID flows
// never looped), `resubmit` (hosted send-backs walked the full flow), and
// `deviceIntelligence` (a workflow's opt-out never reached fingerprint
// collection). A source scan is crude, but it is the check that would have
// caught all three.

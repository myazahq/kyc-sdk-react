// The Myaza mark, as a data URI to drop in the centre of a QR code.
//
// Provenance, at the one moment it is load-bearing. A bare QR is a black box:
// the user is being asked to point their camera at an unreadable square and hand
// over a passport on the other side. The mark makes the destination legible
// before they scan, and matches the "Powered by Myaza Trust" lockup already at
// the foot of the modal.
//
// A data URI rather than a file: the SDK ships as a bundle into other people's
// pages, and an <img src> pointing anywhere would be a network request at the
// exact moment the user is deciding whether to trust us — and would simply fail
// behind a strict CSP.
//
// Paths are the first three from MyazaWordmark (the mark, without the wordmark);
// regenerate both from public/assets/images/logo-white.svg rather than hand-
// editing either.

 * The mark on a squircle tile.
 *
 * A tile, not a bare mark: at the centre of a field of dots an unbacked logo
 * reads as noise, and the rounded ground is the visual convention for "this is
 * an overlay, not part of the code". The white ring around it is the quiet zone
 * that keeps the dots from crowding the tile.
 *
 * Percent-encoded rather than base64 — smaller, and it stays readable in a
 * bundle so nobody has to decode it to see what is being injected into the page.

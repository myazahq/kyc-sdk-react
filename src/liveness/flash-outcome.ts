// What to do once a flash (screen-reflection) sequence has run.
//
// An UNMEASURABLE flash used to count as a pass: bright ambient light drowns
// the reflection, and so does a phone screen held up to the camera, which lights
// itself. That soft pass is exactly what a replay needs. Now:
//
//   - measured and matched          → pass
//   - measured and NOT matched      → fail (a real contradiction)
//   - unmeasurable, first time      → retry once, after asking the person to
//                                     move away from bright light
//   - unmeasurable again, 'both'    → the gestures that ran first carried it
//   - unmeasurable again, 'flash'   → fall back to gesture challenges, so the
//                                     person still proves they are live
//
// Mirrored by the React Native (liveness/flashOutcome.ts) and Flutter
// (liveness/flash_outcome.dart) SDKs. Change all three together.

/**
 * Tracks the SDK's dark class, reactively.
 *
 * The theme toggle flips `.dark` on the THEME ROOT — the SdkFrame's shadow
 * portal frame when the mount is isolated, else `documentElement` (hosted
 * page) — and re-renders ITSELF, so anything computing styles from the theme
 * higher up the tree never heard about it. That was fine while dark mode was
 * pure CSS — but org colours are applied as INLINE custom properties, and an
 * inline style beats the `.dark .kyc-root` rules, so a branded flow kept its
 * light background after toggling to dark. Observing the class is what lets
 * the dark palette be swapped in on toggle.

// The SERVER's list of who a submitted KYB application is waiting on.
//
// Two different kinds of change, treated differently on purpose:
//
// MEMBERSHIP settles once. The registry lookup runs after submission and can add
// people the applicant never listed, so nothing renders until the server says it
// has finished (`keyPeopleSettled`) - a list shown earlier is one director short,
// and rows appearing under the reader is the failure this hook replaced.
//
// STATUS stays live. The people on the list go and verify AFTER this screen is
// first shown, and an applicant sitting on it deserves to see a row turn green
// without hunting for a reload button. Discovery is finished by then, so these
// re-reads can only flip badges, never move the list.
//
// Works for BOTH mount kinds: a hosted page reads by its session token, an
// embedded mount by its sessionId under the API key (the authed summary route).
// Before that second read existed, an embedded success screen could only show
// the submit-time invites — which cannot include the people registry discovery
// adds moments later — so mobile and hosted told different stories about one
// application.

 * short. Never waiting and never rendering are both failures; this picks the

// A resumed session restores the selfie's mediaId, but neither the liveness
// recording (the web SDK uploads it at submit, from memory) nor the liveness
// claim that says how the selfie was taken. A selfie with neither behind it is
// not proof of a live person: the server records a missing recording as a
// finding and refuses a face re-authentication without a claim. So on restore
// the selfie is dropped and, when the saved step comes after liveness, the
// person is sent back to take it again.
//
// Same rule as the React Native SDK's lib/livenessResume.ts and the Flutter
// SDK's config/liveness_resume.dart. Change all three together.

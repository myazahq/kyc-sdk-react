  // require throws `exports is not defined in ES module scope`, and on Node 24
  // it silently resolves to an object with ZERO keys, so every icon renders as
  // nothing. Left external, the CJS build of this SDK inherits that. Inlined,
  // the icon path data is plain arrays that tree-shake to the ones we draw and
  // no consumer ever requires the broken package.
